# Line-Follower-Maze-Solver

## Final Result

In this project, I worked with hardware and software to build and program a rebot that navigates a 
maze and race on a complex, sharp turning course. My resulting robot successful completed both tasks 
along with fufilling additional requirements. 

My robot used light sensors at the bottom to detect the difference between the white surface and black line 
that it had to follow. Along with this, it used a memory array to remember previous maneuvers so that it was 
able to solve the maze as efficiently as possible. Additional abilities of the robot was to automatically stop 
when being picked up and start when being placed down because of acceleration in the z-axis. 

The robot also used a configuration of lights and a display to tell the user where the robot is in relation to the line 
and what actions the robot is currently performing such as stop, turning right or left, backing up, deceleration or rotating if bumped into 
obstacle along with a couple other abilities.

The course taught a plethora of concepts including interrupts, timers, pointers, finite state machines along with other embedded circuit 
concepts.
